```javascript
// Work In Progress
```

The `falkor-library` project is a collection of DevOps tools written in strict ES6 TypeScript to be used with the **Falkor Framework**.

## **Usage**

```typescript
import falkor from "@falkor/falkor-library";

// extend Task
class ExampleTask extends falkor.Task {
    constructor() {
        super(
            // name of the current sequence batch
            "Task Example",
            // *optional* global command-line dependencies
            {
                // lazy shorthand syntax
                git: "2.30.1",
                // below dependency object is the equivalent of "11.0.1" (lazy shorthand syntax string, like above)
                // this is *exactly* how the library unfolds shorthand dependencies
                // @see TaskRunner::mergeDependencies
                "clang++": {
                    command: "clang++ --version",
                    minVersion: "11.0.1",
                    versionMatch: /version\s*([^\s]+)/
                }
            }
        );
    }

    // necessary implementation of abstract async function (entry point)
    public async run(): Promise<void> {
        // asynchronous command-line execution
        // (command output is handled by library)
        const fetchResult = await this.exec("git fetch --all --tags" /*+ " --recurse-submodules" /**/, {
            // current working directory for command
            cwd: "../falkor-library"
        });
        // the library does not throw errors (apart in setup stage), once running it only reports failure(s)
        if (!fetchResult.success) {
            // built in method, that *throws* library acceptable error
            // (reducing state to PANIC, allowing task level clean-up, then exiting with non-zero exit code)
            this.error("failed fetch");
        }

        const commitResult = await this.exec("git commit", {
            cwd: "../falkor-library",
            // exceptions are silenced, when output is tested positive for any of these *optional* regular expressions
            noError: [/nothing to commit, working tree clean/]
        });
        if (!commitResult.success) {
            this.error("failed commit");
        }

        // request input from the user
        const answer1 = await this.ask(
            // the text of the "question" is necessary
            "try selection:",
            {
                // if answers are provided, the input will be tested against them
                answers: ["node", "python", "erlang", "go", "php", "lisp", "fortran"],
                // forces answer items to be displayed line-by-line
                // (this also makes them selectable by answer number, or interactively)
                list: true
            }
        );
        if (answer1 === null) {
            // currently this can only happen after predefined number of wrong answers, or after timeout
            this.error("failed input");
        }

        // allows multiple selection (separated by commas, or by interactive input)
        const answer2 = await this.ask("try multi-selection:", {
            // if answers are provided, the input will be tested against them
            answers: ["node", "python", "erlang", "go", "php", "lisp", "fortran"],
            // forces answer items to be displayed line-by-line
            // (this also makes them selectable by answer number-, or interactively)
            list: true,
            // if answers are provided, this will allow multiple selection
            // (with- or without list mode)
            multi: true
        });
        if (answer2 === null) {
            this.error("failed input");
        }

        // the logger instance is used to display formatted data throughout the batch
        this.logger
            // new prompt for all further logs, newlines in logs will be indented with same length whitespace
            .pushPrompt("[NIRVANA]")
            // level of output is based on configuration, one can use:
            // debug(), notice(), info(), warning(), error(), fatal()
            // @see LogLevel
            .info("luv' this band")
            // prompts also support internal ansi color sequence(s) - if underlying terminal does too
            .pushPrompt(this.theme.formatTrace("nevermind"))
            // (level of output can be overridden in the '.ops.json' file in project root)
            // @see LogLevel
            .info(
                // inline styling of log chunks is always done through the theme
                this.theme.formatSuccess(
                    // ascii is a new addition, currently it creates lists, and ascii figlet fonts
                    // (newlines are padded correctly by library, extra one added to the end for readability)
                    this.ascii.font("I'm done", "Big")
                )
            )
            // discard the last two demonstrational prompts
            .popPrompt(2);
    }
}
```

## **Further Development**

The project uses the [`@falkor/falkor-bundler`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@falkor/falkor-bundler "Visit") module to compile sources. You can run:

```
$ npm run [ debug | release ]
```

> _**SEE**: `"scripts"` entry in [`package.json`](https://github.com/theonethread/falkor-library/blob/master/package.json "Open")_

### **Documentation**

To generate HTML documentation from the TypeScript sources under the ignored `.doc` directory using [Typedoc](https://typedoc.org "Visit") run:

```
$ npm run doc
```

Or one can visit the exported [online documentation](https://theonethread.github.io/falkor-library-doc "Visit").

### **Versioning and Branching Strategy**

Release sources can be found on the `master` branch, this one always points to the latest tagged release. Previous sources of releases' can be found using Git version tags (or browsing GitHub releases). Released packages can be found on [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@falkor/falkor-auth-server "Visit").

The repository's main branch is `develop` (due to technical reasons), this holds all developments that are already decided to be included in the next release. Usually this branch is ahead of master one patch version (but based on upcoming features to include this can become minor, or major), so prepared external links may yet be broken.

The `feature/*` branches usually hold ideas and POC code, these will only be merged into `develop` once their impact measured and quality meets release requirements.

> _The project uses [SemVer](https://semver.org "Visit"), Git tags are prefixed with a `v` character._

### **GitHub Actions**

The workflows can be found [here](https://github.com/theonethread/falkor-library/blob/develop/.github/workflows "Open").

#### **Continuous Integration**

Automatic builds are achieved via GitHub actions, CI will make nightly builds of the `develop` branch (using Ubuntu image), and test `master` when there is a pull request, or commit on it (using Ubuntu - Win - MacOS image matrix).

#### **API Documentation**

There is also a manually triggered workflow, that deploys generated documentation to [GitHub Pages](https://theonethread.github.io/falkor-library-doc "Visit").

#### **Security**

The project uses [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com "Visit") and [Snyk](https://snyk.io "Visit") to ensure standard security.
