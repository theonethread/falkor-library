The `falkor-library` project is a collection of devops tools written in strict ES6 TypeScript to be used with the **Falkor Framework**.

## **Usage**

See the following projects consuming the `falkor-library`:

- [`@falkor/falkor-commander`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@falkor/falkor-commander "Visit"): plugin based task runner / -sequencer
- [`falkor-plugin-example`](https://github.com/theonethread/falkor-plugin-example/tree/master "Visit"): example `falkor-commander` plugin to demonstrate framework capabilities

### **Configuration**

The `falkor-library` looks for shared configurations in the Current Working Directory from where the application consuming it was executed (files could be named `.falkorrc`, `.ops.json`, `.ops.jsonc`, `falkor.json`, or `falkor.jsonc` - whichever is found first).

To see all available settings, and also example `falkor-commander` and plugin customizations check out the big [`.ops.jsonc`](https://github.com/theonethread/falkor-plugin-example/blob/develop/.ops.jsonc "Open") file provided as example in [`falkor-plugin-example`](https://github.com/theonethread/falkor-plugin-example "Visit").

## **Further Development**

The project uses the [`@falkor/falkor-bundler`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@falkor/falkor-bundler "Visit") module to compile sources. To clone the repository and compile `falkor-library` one can use the commands:

```
$ git clone --branch develop git@github.com:theonethread/falkor-library.git
$ cd falkor-library
$ npm install
$ npm run [ debug | release ]
```

> _**SEE:** `"scripts"` entry in [`package.json`](https://github.com/theonethread/falkor-library/blob/master/package.json "Open") for further reference._

> _**NOTE:** Compiling the `develop` sources might need locally linked `develop` versions of downstream module:_
>
> - _[`@falkor/falkor-bundler`](https://github.com/theonethread/falkor-bundler/tree/develop "Visit")_
>
> _**SEE:** [`npm-link`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-link "Visit") for further reference._

### **Documentation**

To generate HTML documentation from the TypeScript sources under the ignored `.doc` directory using [Typedoc](https://typedoc.org "Visit") run:

```
$ npm run doc
```

Or one can visit the exported [online documentation](https://theonethread.github.io/falkor-library-doc "Visit").

### **Versioning and Branching Strategy**

Release sources can be found on the `master` branch, this one always points to the latest tagged release. Previous sources of releases can be found using Git version tags (or browsing GitHub releases). Released packages can be found on [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@falkor/falkor-auth-server "Visit").

The repository's main branch is `develop` (due to technical reasons), this holds all developments that are already decided to be included in the next release. Usually this branch is ahead of `master` one patch version (but based on upcoming features to include this can become minor, or major), so prepared external links may yet be broken.

The `feature/*` branches usually hold ideas and POC code, these will only be merged into `develop` once their impact measured and quality meets release requirements.

> _The project uses [SemVer](https://semver.org "Visit"), Git tags are prefixed with a `v` character._

### **GitHub Actions**

The workflows can be found [here](https://github.com/theonethread/falkor-library/blob/develop/.github/workflows "Open").

#### **Continuous Integration**

Automatic builds are achieved via GitHub actions, CI will make nightly builds of the `develop` branch (using Ubuntu image), and test `master` when there is a pull request, or commit on it (using Ubuntu - Win - MacOS image matrix).

#### **API Documentation**

There is also a manually triggered workflow, that deploys generated documentation to [GitHub Pages](https://theonethread.github.io/falkor-library-doc "Visit").

### **Security**

The project uses [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com "Visit") and [Snyk](https://snyk.io "Visit") to ensure standard security.

### **Free and Open Source**

The latest sources can always be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/theonethread/falkor-library "Visit").

#### **Getting Involved**

We believe - and we hope you do too - that learning how to code, how to think, and how to contribute to free- and open source software can empower the next generation of coders and creators. We **value** first time contributors just the same as rock stars of the OSS world, so if you're interested in getting involved, just head over to our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/theonethread/.github/blob/master/.github/contributing.md "Open") for a quick heads-up!
